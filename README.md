# This was a game made in 2016 for a Computer Science Course, intro to game dev
## the main goal is to catch the multicolored spheres, while avoiding the X's
## Upon collecting the spheres a note may be heard using the Sound method of JS
## Upon hitting four X's, the game end.
## Code needs refactored, movement needs respun, graphics need improved, score needs retooled for modern JS
